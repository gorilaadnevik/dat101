      <li>[is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes, itâ€™s possible to solve many problems with a single "for" loop]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
      <p>[Yes, you can create an infinite loop in a "while" loop by setting a condition that is always true]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
        <p>[The speed at which a computer can compute a solution depends on the efficiency of the algorithm and the number of possible guesses.]</p>
        <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
          change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
          matter?]</li>
          <p>[In nested "for" loops, the order does not change the outcome but does affect how data is processed.]</p>
